# Data Science Assignment 1: Langevin Dynamics and Airbnb Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This assignment consists of two main tasks:
1. Implementing Langevin Dynamics Sampling
2. Creating Interactive Airbnb Data Dashboards in Tableau

### Task 1: Langevin Dynamics Sampling
Implement a sampling algorithm that explores probability distributions using the following key components:
- Score function calculation
- Sampling from a 2D Gaussian distribution
- Visualization of sampling trajectories

#### Key Objectives
- Implement score function for a given probability distribution
- Generate samples using Langevin Dynamics algorithm
- Compare sampling methods (Langevin Dynamics vs NumPy multivariate normal)

### Task 2: Airbnb Data Dashboard in Tableau
Create an interactive data story using Airbnb listing data with multiple dashboards.

#### Datasets
- `Airbnb_Listings.xls`: Contains listing details
- `Neighborhood_Locations.xlsx`: Provides geographical information

#### Dashboard Requirements
- Minimum of 3 interconnected dashboards
- Interactive elements (filters, parameters)
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Structured narrative with introduction, findings, and conclusion
