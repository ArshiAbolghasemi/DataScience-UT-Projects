# Introduction to Data Science - Assignment 0

## Overview
This assignment explores fundamental statistical concepts through three main tasks:
1. Roulette Simulation and Profit Analysis
2. Predicting the 2016 USA Presidential Election
3. Drug Safety Test Analysis

## Task Descriptions

### 1. Roulette Simulation and Profit Analysis
Simulates the American roulette game focusing on betting on black to analyze expected outcomes:
- Implements simulation function for N rounds of betting
- Studies distribution of total earnings for N = 10, 25, 100, 1000
- Analyzes average winnings distributions
- Compares theoretical and simulated expected values and standard errors
- Applies Central Limit Theorem to approximate casino loss probability
- Plots casino loss probability as a function of N

### 2. Predicting the 2016 USA Presidential Election
Analyzes polling data to predict the 2016 US presidential election:
- Derives and computes 95% confidence intervals for voter proportions
- Validates confidence intervals using Monte Carlo simulation
- Creates time-series plots of poll results for Trump and Clinton
- Calculates estimated voter proportions with confidence intervals
- Determines the support spread between candidates
- Conducts hypothesis testing on the spread

### 3. Drug Safety Test
Evaluates drug safety through statistical analysis:
- Performs basic statistical analysis on the dataset
- Groups and summarizes key statistics by treatment group
- Conducts independent t-tests to compare metrics between Drug and Placebo groups:
  - White blood cell count
  - Red blood cell count
  - Number of adverse effects
  - Presence of adverse effects
- Interprets p-values against different significance levels
